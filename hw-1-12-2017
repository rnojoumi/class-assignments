ABSOLUTE VS RELATIVE PATHS CORRECT ANSWERS:
	5. cd ~ is a shortcut for home directory 
	7. cd ~/data/ .. this command will navigate up to home directory, then down to data and then back up to home directory again
	8. cd this command alone navigates to home directory 
	9. cd .. navigates up which would be the home directory in this case

RELATIVE PATH RESOLUTION CORRECT ANSWER: 
	4. original pnas_final pnas_sub
		the command " ls ../backup" will navigate up to Users (..) and then down to backup (/backup) an will show the contents of  			it which are: original, pnas_final and pnas_sub

ls READING COMPREHENSION CORRECT ANSWER:
	2. ls -r -F
	3. ls -r -F /Users/backup
	4. choice 2 and 3 both correct 
		the list the question asked for display is in the directory that we are in, so ls alone would show all the contents. the 			-r would list them in reverse order and -F adds / to the names. in choice 3 the path is explicitly shown again which is 		unnecessary but correct.
